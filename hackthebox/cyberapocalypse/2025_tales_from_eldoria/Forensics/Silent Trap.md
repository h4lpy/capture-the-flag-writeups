# Silent Trap

A critical incident has occurred in Tales from Eldoria, trapping thousands of players in the virtual world with no way to log out. The cause has been traced back to Malakar, a mysterious entity that launched a sophisticated attack, taking control of the developers' and system administrators' computers. With key systems compromised, the game is unable to function properly, which is why players remain trapped in Eldoria. Now, you must investigate what happened and find a way to restore the system, freeing yourself from the game before it's too late.
