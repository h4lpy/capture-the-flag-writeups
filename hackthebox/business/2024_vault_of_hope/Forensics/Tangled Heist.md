# Tangled heist

Difficulty: Easy

The survivors' group has meticulously planned the mission 'Tangled Heist' for months. In the desolate wasteland, what appears to be an abandoned facility is, in reality, the headquarters of a rebel faction. This faction guards valuable data that could be useful in reaching the vault. Kaila, acting as an undercover agent, successfully infiltrates the facility using a rebel faction member's account and gains access to a critical asset containing invaluable information. This data holds the key to both understanding the rebel faction's organization and advancing the survivors' mission to reach the vault.
