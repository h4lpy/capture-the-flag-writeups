# Mitigation

Difficulty: Medium

Having now gathered all the intelligence, you are now making the final preparations to attack the vault! You connect back to your server to review some important evidence one last time! However, as soon as you connect you discover things are in complete disorder. You check the root directory and you find `/root/backdoor.log`, clearly evidence of an active backdoor, set in place to hinder your assault on the Vault! Eliminate the backdoor in order to continue with your plans!  

Note: A new line is added in the logfile approx. every minute indicating the status of the backdoor  

Note 2: Connect to the server using SSH and `root:toor` as credentials  

Note 3: You need to be connected to the CTF VPN in order to reach the server
