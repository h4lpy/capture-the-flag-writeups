# Dynamic Paths

Difficulty: Easy

On your way to the vault, you decide to follow the underground tunnels, a vast and complicated network of paths used by early humans before the great war. From your previous hack, you already have a map of the tunnels, along with information like distances between sections of the tunnels. While you were studying it to figure your path, a wild super mutant behemoth came behind you and started attacking. Without a second thought, you run into the tunnel, but the behemoth came running inside as well. Can you use your extensive knowledge of the underground tunnels to reach your destination fast and outrun the behemoth?
