Big men, trouble makers, shotguns, riffles, roasted ants, nuclear soda, some scrapped hacky-boys, a power armor and more are all essential for the job. As you go to the different merchants, you soon start to realize that you're gonna start gathering a lot of stuff. Your team may be strong, but there's a limit to what they can lift. But that musn't sacrifice the quality of products you get. Can you devise a way to get the best products without going over your physical limits?
