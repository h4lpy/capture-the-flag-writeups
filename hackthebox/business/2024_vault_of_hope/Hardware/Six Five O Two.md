# Six Five O Two

Difficulty: Medium

In the tunnels beneath the wasteland, the crew makes their way to the heavily fortified Vault 79. After a perilous journey, they approach the access port on the side of the vault door frame, where the ancient 6502 CPU is located. They connect their Pip-Boy, which they have added a new mod that enables it to act as a flashing device, via the port's debugging interface. The Pip-Boy's screen illuminates the tunnel as green and red diodes flicker on the power box. The team's hardware specialist expertly manipulates the device, attempting to flash and override the firmware. With tense breaths held among the crew, a final green light overtakes the red. Can you help manage to open the door?.
