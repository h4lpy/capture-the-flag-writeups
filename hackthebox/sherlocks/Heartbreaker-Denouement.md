# Heartbreaker-Denouement

```
Your digital forensics expertise is critical to determine whether data exfiltration has occurred from the customerâ€™s environment. Initial findings include a compromised AWS credential, indicating a potential unauthorized access. This investigation follows from a customer report of leaked data allegedly for sale on the darknet market. By examining the compromised server and analyzing the provided AWS logs, it will not only validate the customer's breach report but also provide valuable insights into the attacker's tactics, enabling a more comprehensive response.
