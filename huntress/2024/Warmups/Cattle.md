# Cattle

I know it's an esoteric challenge for a Capture the Flag, but could you herd these cows for me?

File: [cattle]()

-----

We are given a text file, `cattle`, containing strings, as follows:

```
...
moO moO MMM MOO MOo moO MoO mOo moo moO MoO MoO MoO MoO MoO MoO MoO MoO MoO MoO MoO Moo
...
```

Given the challenge description, this is an esoteric language (esolang) known as [COW code](https://esolangs.org/wiki/COW). We can use an [interpreter](https://www.cachesleuth.com/cow.html) to decode it:

```
