# Lookey Here

Attackers have hidden information in a very large mass of data in the past, maybe they are still doing it. Download the data [here](https://artifacts.picoctf.net/c/125/anthem.flag.txt).

-----

We are given an `anthem.flag.txt` file which contains the flag in plaintext:

```
$ cat anthem.flag.txt | grep "picoCTF"
picoCTF{gr3p_15_@w3s0m3_58f5c024}
```

```
picoCTF{gr3p_15_@w3s0m3_58f5c024}
```
