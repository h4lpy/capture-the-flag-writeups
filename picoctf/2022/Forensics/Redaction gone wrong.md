# Redaction gone wrong

Now you DONâ€™T see me. This [report](https://artifacts.picoctf.net/c/84/Financial_Report_for_ABC_Labs.pdf) has some critical data in it, some of which have been redacted correctly, while some were not. Can you find an important key that was not redacted properly?

We are given a PDF file, `Financial_Report_for_ABC_Labs.pdf`, which has elements redacted:

Copying the contents into notepad, we see that the redactions are simply black images overlaying text:
