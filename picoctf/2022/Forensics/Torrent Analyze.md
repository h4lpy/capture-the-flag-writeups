# Torrent Analyze

SOS, someone is torrenting on our network. One of your colleagues has been using torrent to download some files on the companyâ€™s network. Can you identify the file(s) that were downloaded? The file name will be the flag, like `picoCTF{filename}`. [Captured traffic](https://artifacts.picoctf.net/c/165/torrent.pcap).

-----

We are given a PCAP, `torrent.pcap`, of UDP traffic.

Within torrent traffic, we can look for `info_hash` which is the SHA1 sum of the torrent file being downloaded.

With our source being `192.168.73.132`, we can filter on this and the BT-DHT packets:

```
bt-dht.bencoded.string contains info_hash and ip.src == 192.168.73.132
```

```
info_hash: e2467cbf021192c241367b892230dc1e05c0580e
```

Googling this reveals a [TorrentKitty](https://cn.torrentkitty.net/information/E2467CBF021192C241367B892230DC1E05C0580E) entry for `ubuntu-19.10-desktop-amd64.iso`:
