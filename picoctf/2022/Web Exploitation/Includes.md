Looking at the source code, we see a file `script.js` which contains the second part of the flag:

```js
function greetings()
{
  alert("This code is in a separate file!");
}

//  f7w_2of2_b8f4b022}
```

The first part of the flag is in `style.css`:

```css
body {
  background-color: lightblue;
}

/*  picoCTF{1nclu51v17y_1of2_  */
```

```
picoCTF{1nclu51v17y_1of2_f7w_2of2_b8f4b022}
```
