Looking at the source code, the button runs the `continueAsGuest()` function from `guest.js` file when clicked. This file checks whether a cookie called `isAdmin` is equal to `0`

```js
function continueAsGuest()
{
  window.location.href = '/check.php';
  document.cookie = "isAdmin=0";
}
```

Changing this value allows us to get the flag:
