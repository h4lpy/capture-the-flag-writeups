# Dear Diary

If you can find the flag on this disk image, we can close the case for good! Download the disk image [here](https://artifacts.picoctf.net/c_titan/63/disk.flag.img.gz).

-----

Unzipping the archive with `gunzip` and loading it within Autopsy, we can search for `txt` as a keyword to find the flag. 

The flag is broken up into segments from `7:70` to `16:70`
